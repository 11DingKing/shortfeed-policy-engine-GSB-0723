"""Reason codes.

Every decision the engine makes — allowing or denying a session action, or
rejecting a request — is tagged with a stable :class:`ReasonCode`. Codes are the
public contract: clients branch on them and they appear verbatim in decision
traces, so their string values must never change once released.
