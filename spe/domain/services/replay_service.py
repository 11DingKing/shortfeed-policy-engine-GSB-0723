"""Historical replay service.

Given a finished (or in-flight) session, re-derive its settlement by replaying
its recorded heartbeats against the *pinned* policy version. Because both the
policy document and the accounting rules are deterministic, the replay reproduces
the original per-day settlement exactly — the tool used to audit disputes and to
prove that publishing new versions never rewrote history.

The replay mirrors :meth:`SessionService.heartbeat`: age is derived dynamically
from the session's birth date at each heartbeat instant (no hard-coded age),
proposed deltas are split across local midnight and truncated to the remaining
session and daily budgets. An optional ``daily_baseline`` supplies watch-time
other sessions had already booked against a given local day, so a session that
shared a day with siblings can still be reproduced faithfully.
