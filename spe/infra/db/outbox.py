"""Transactional outbox relay.

Domain events are written to the ``outbox`` table in the same transaction as the
state change that produced them. This relay reads unpublished rows and hands them
to a publisher, marking them published only after success — giving at-least-once
delivery without a distributed transaction. In this reference implementation the
default publisher logs; production would swap in Kafka/SNS/etc.
